# Complex-Contagion

In this repository you can find the final report of my group for the course "Physics of complex networks: structure and dynamics" held in Spring 2023 at the Master of Physics of data in Pauda.
The project aimed to study cascade failures in complex networks. In particular I worked on the complex contagion problem, reproducing the results of the Watts threshold model.
